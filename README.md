# Crawford_FINAL_Project_Inventory_System
This was my final project for the CIS 161 - Intro C++ course. For this project we were tasked with making an inventory system in a console application. This was a fun little project and I was able to meet the basic requirements and also added some additional features that would make this a more usable app.
